Car Price Calculator
====================

This script is used to calculate the price of a car based on the selected options. The options include:

* Brand
* Model
* Body Type
* Trim Level
* Engine
* Fuel Type
* Transmission
* Engine Power
* Engine Efficiency
* Engine Emission

Getting Started
---------------

To use the script, you will need to have PHP and a web server installed on your computer. You will also need a CSV file containing data on the available options and prices.

1. Download the script and place it in the root directory of your web server.
2. Place the CSV file containing the data in the same directory as the script.
3. Open the script in a text editor and edit the `$file` variable in the `read_csv()` function to match the name of your CSV file.
4. Access the script in your web browser by visiting `http://localhost/path-to-script/`.
5. Select the options you want, and then click the "Calculate Price" button to get the final price.

Script Structure
----------------

The script consists of two main parts:

1. A form for selecting the options
2. A PHP script that handles the form data and calculates the price based on the selected options

The form is created using HTML and PHP and is used to display the available options to the user. The options are taken from the CSV file and are used to create the select elements in the form.

The PHP script is used to handle the form data and calculate the final price based on the selected options. The script reads the data from the CSV file and uses it to determine the price of the selected options.

Customizing the Script
----------------------

You can customize the script to match your specific needs by editing the form and the PHP script.

* You can add more options or remove existing options by editing the form and the PHP script accordingly.
* You can change the way the price is calculated by editing the PHP script.
* You can change the way the options are displayed by editing the HTML and PHP code in the form.
* You can change the way the data is read from the CSV file by editing the `read_csv()` function in the PHP script.
* You can change the styling of the form by editing the CSS code.

Limitations
-----------

* The script assumes that the data in the CSV file is in a specific format, and may not work correctly if the data is in a different format.
* The script does not include any error handling for invalid data, so it may not work correctly if the data in the CSV file is invalid.
* The script does not include any security measures, so it should not be used on a public-facing website without proper security measures in place.

Conclusion
----------

This script is a basic example of how you can use PHP and a CSV file to create a car price calculator. It can be customized to match your specific needs, but it should be used with caution on a public-facing website.
